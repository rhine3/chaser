# Find species-rich eBird locations

Get frequencies for one county

```{r}
library("rebird")
county_freqs <- ebirdfreq(loc = 'US-VA-003', loctype='counties', date='2019-02-14',max=10)
county_freqs
```

Get a list of all counties for a region: not implemented in `rebird` yet.

Remove certain species from consideration by common name:

```{r}
spp_to_remove <- list("Snow Goose", "Ross's Goose")

subset_county_freqs <- subset(county_freqs, comName != spp_to_remove)
subset_county_freqs
```
